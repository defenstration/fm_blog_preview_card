## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

This was a pretty straightforward project that let me consolidate some styling knowledge.

### Continued development

The next steps are to finish up the Frontend Mentors intro path. There are two more starter projects, then I'm getting back into JS after having focused on HTML and CSS for the past week or so. As I was building this project I kept thinking about how it would play when I was returning multiple cards. 

I do think I got a little carried away on my styling. I want to get to a point where my code is more optimized. All in all though, I have been having a lot of fun doing these projects.

## Acknowledgments

Olena (@helenhapp) on frontendmentor.io - On my last project I had some funny styling when adding in some elements for accessibility. Olena pointed out that I could use a screen reader only class to help out with it (I tried that out in this project). Thank you Olena!
